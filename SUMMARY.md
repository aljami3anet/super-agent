# AI Coder Agent - Project Summary

## Project Overview
AI Coder Agent is an autonomous coding system with multi-agent orchestration, real-time collaboration, and intelligent code generation capabilities.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Initialization (Phase 1/10)
- **Progress**: 15% complete
- **Last Updated**: 2024-12-19

## Key Components

### Backend (Python 3.11 + FastAPI)
- Multi-agent architecture with Planner, Coder, Critic, Tester, Summarizer
- OpenTelemetry integration for observability
- PostgreSQL data layer with migrations
- Comprehensive tool functions for file operations, Git, testing

### Frontend (React + TypeScript + Tailwind)
- Modern UI with dark theme support
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- Dashboard, logs streaming, configuration views
- WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliance

### Infrastructure
- Docker multi-stage builds
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Security scanning and SBOM generation
- Rate limiting and graceful shutdown

## Architecture Decisions
1. **Monorepo Structure**: Backend and frontend in single repository for easier coordination
2. **Multi-Agent System**: Specialized agents for different coding tasks with orchestration
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based streaming for live collaboration
4. **Observability First**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing
5. **Quality Gates**: 95%+ test coverage and automated quality checks

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, OpenTelemetry
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, GitHub Actions, PostgreSQL
- **AI**: OpenRouter API with fallback model routing

## Next Steps
- Complete Phase 1: Project initialization
- Begin Phase 2: Backend scaffold implementation
- Set up development environment and tooling

## Notes
- Project follows strict quality gates and testing requirements
- Comprehensive documentation and deployment guides planned
- Security and GDPR compliance built into design
