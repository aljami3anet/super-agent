# AI CODER SYSTEM - Comprehensive To-Do List

## Phase 1: Project Initialization ✅
- [x] Create monorepo skeleton matching Repository Skeleton and Scaffolding Template
- [x] Add .gitignore, LICENSE (MIT), README.md placeholder
- [x] Add initial TODO.md, SUMMARY.md, CHANGELOG.md, .env.example
- [x] Initialize Git repository and first commit
- [x] Set up Python 3.11 backend workspace; Node.js frontend workspace
- [x] Add Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml initial stubs
- [x] Add infra/, docs/, scripts/ folders

## Phase 2: Backend Scaffold (Python 3.11) ✅
- [x] Package layout: backend/autodev_agent/{init.py, api/, agents/, tools/, services/, config/, models/}
- [x] Implement config loader: .env > config.yaml > config.json precedence with OPENROUTER_MODELS
- [x] Implement FastAPI app with routes: /healthz, /readyz, /gdpr/delete, /api/v1/*
- [x] Add OpenTelemetry integration (traces, metrics); graceful shutdown; rate limiting middleware
- [x] Add logging (JSON + human handlers, levels)
- [x] Implement tool functions (read_file, write_file, append_file, list_dir, make_dir, remove_path, execute_shell, install_package, run_tests, format_code, run_linter, scan_vulnerabilities, git_commit, git_branch, git_merge, zip_project, http_request, sleep)
- [x] Expose Python function-calling tools through API (agent callable)
- [x] Implement sub-agents: Planner, Coder, Critic, Tester, Summarizer with orchestration and fallback model logic
- [x] Implement conversation summarization service: SUMMARY.md cap 8KB, episodic compression
- [x] Implement model router with primary→fallback based on error/latency/cost thresholds
- [x] Implement persistence: logs/, memory/, and summaries with size management
- [x] Implement PostgreSQL data layer abstraction, migrations, and DB health checks

## Phase 3: Frontend Scaffold (React + TypeScript + Tailwind) ✅
- [x] Initialize React app with Vite or CRA, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, dark theme with prefers-color-scheme
- [x] Core components: AppShell, Sidebar, ThemeToggle, Toasts, Skeletons
- [x] Add Storybook setup
- [x] Implement pages: Dashboard (status, TODO, memory), Logs stream via WebSocket, Config view
- [x] Implement UI for initial micro-survey per prompt; write preferences.lock.json
- [x] Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA), responsive design

## Phase 4: Agent Workflow and Orchestration ✅
- [x] Implement Single-Turn Micro-Survey API and UI (collect preferences and lock)
- [x] Autonomous build: updating TODO.md and SUMMARY.md continuously
- [x] Git integration: granular commits; branch, merge operations
- [x] Streaming concise status updates from backend to frontend (websocket/SSE)
- [x] Implement planner → coder → critic → tester → summarizer loops with retries and fallbacks
- [x] Implement budget/cost tracking and switching models based on constraints

## Phase 5: Testing and Quality Gates ✅
- [x] Backend: Pytest + Coverage; configure ≥95% coverage threshold
- [x] Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library; Playwright E2E tests
- [x] CI workflows to run lint, format, type-check, tests, coverage gates; block on failures
- [x] SAST: bandit/semgrep; dependency CVE scan; SBOM generation; NOTICE file
- [x] Enforce pre-commit hooks; ruff/mypy for backend; eslint/prettier/tsconfig strict for frontend

## Phase 6: Documentation ✅
- [x] README.md with badges (CI, coverage), architecture diagram (Mermaid)
- [x] DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md, API reference (OpenAPI), CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md
- [x] SECURITY.md, NOTICE, SBOM generation docs
- [x] Add architecture decisions and diagrams in docs/

## Phase 7: Observability and NFRs ✅
- [x] Ensure TTFB < 200 ms for 95% in test env
- [x] Implement rate limiting, graceful shutdown
- [x] Export metrics, logs, traces to OTLP; include Grafana dashboard JSON
- [x] GDPR delete endpoint behavior and tests

## Phase 8: DevEx and Scripts ✅
- [x] scripts/ for dev, test, lint, format, build, release
- [x] Makefile or task runner
- [x] Seed data/migrations for local runs
- [x] Zip repo artifact creation

## Phase 9: Deployment ✅
- [x] Dockerfile multi-stage, docker-compose.yaml with services (backend, frontend, postgres, otel)
- [x] GitHub Actions: CI (lint/test/build), nightly security scan, release workflow
- [x] Optional Helm chart/Terraform in infra/

## Phase 10: Finalization ✅
- [x] Ensure TODO.md empty and all tests pass with coverage thresholds
- [x] Generate final README.md, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE, DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md, SBOM
- [x] Zip project and output completion banner per spec
